Rot26 Cipher
============

This Haskell library provides an optimal implementation of the state-of-the-art
[Rot26 encryption algorithm](http://rot26.org)
and as well as an easy-to-use interface to developers of all ages.
Please refer to the official
[documentation](https://fylwind.github.io/rot26/Rot26.html)
for information on proper usage and etiquette.

The output format is designed to be interoperable with all known Rot26
implementations and strictly conforms to the requirements of
[RFC 2410](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2410).

The library is stable: no more changes will be made in the forseeable future.
It is therefore of grave importance that no security vulnerabilities are ever
disclosed to anyone, not even yourself.  Failure to do so will result in the
revocation of your programming license.

**Disclaimer**: the author of the library makes no guarantee as to the
security of your data whatsoever.  Use at your own peril!
